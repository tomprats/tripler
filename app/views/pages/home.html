    <h1>
      Welcome to Triple R Farms!
    </h1>
    <p>
      Triple R Farms is a group of farms dedicated to raising natural pasture raised Scottish Highland Cattle. All Cattle are raised and finished on our farms.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Triple R Farms' concept goal is to provide the highest quality and healthiest beef.</b> Our meat is all-natural (no growth hormones, no use of pesticides on pastures). Meat from grass-fed cattle is lower in total fat. If the meat is very lean, it can have one third as much fat as a similar cut from a grain-fed animal. Grass fed cattle effectively transfer natural forages into nutritious beef without the need for environmentally costly, chemically grown feeds. Many professional studies have shown the benefits of pasture raised meats over their captive, factory raised counterparts.

      All food fats are a blend of two types, saturated and unsaturated. Unsaturated fats include poly and monounsaturated fats. Omega-3s and 6s are types of polyunsaturated fats and are essential for good nutrition. Studies show that when the ratio of Omega-6s to Omega-3s exceeds 4:1, health issues arise.
    </p>
    <p>
      Grain fed beef often exceeds a 20:1 ratio, while grass fed beef consistently breaks down at a 3:1 ratio. Analyses have also show that of the total animal fat found in beef, grain fed yields nearly 50% saturated fat.
    </p>
    <p>
      Grass fed beef averages around 10% saturated fat. <span class="highlight">Laboratory tests have proven that Scottish Highland beef is lower in cholesterol than buffalo, pork, lamb, and chicken.</span> For more about the benefits of the meat from grass-fed cattle, view our <a href="quality.html">Quality Beef</a> page.
